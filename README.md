# Student Absenteeism Management
# # Project Overview
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our university adopted e-learning. In my second year of engineering, our professor tasked us with developing a real-time dashboard to monitor student attendance in online classes. The goal was to track key KPIs such as:

Absenteeism rate
Attendance percentage per major
Student login activity over time


# Pipeline & Implementation

# # Data Extraction:

Collected real-time data from Microsoft Teams.
Extracted and updated the data repository automatically.


# # Data Processing & Orchestration:

Built an ETL pipeline to clean and transform the data.
Used Apache Airflow to schedule and orchestrate the workflow.
Stored processed data in PostgreSQL.


# # KPI Calculation & Visualization:

Calculated absenteeism and attendance KPIs.
Connected the processed data to Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.


# # Tools & Technologies
Cloud & Data Processing: Azure, Airflow
Database: PostgreSQL
Visualization: Power BI
Programming & Querying: Python, SQL


This project provided real-time insights into student engagement, helping faculty make informed decisions on improving online learning participation.

Would love to discuss it further! ðŸš€
